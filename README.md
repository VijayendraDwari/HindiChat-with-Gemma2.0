#### Unsloth Gemma Hindi NLP Project
This repository contains a Colab notebook that demonstrates the development and fine-tuning of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models for Hindi language tasks. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation pipelines tailored for applications such as translation, sentiment analysis, and conversational AI.

Methodology and Dataset Overview
Methodology
This project uses the Unsloth Gemma-2-9B model to fine-tune and evaluate a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model for Hindi language tasks. The methodology involves:

Model Selection:

The base model, unsloth/gemma-2-9b, supports RoPE scaling, 4-bit quantization for memory efficiency, and fine-tuning with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation).
Flash Attention 2 is utilized to enable softcapping and improve efficiency during training.
Prompt Design:

A custom Hindi Alpaca Prompt Template is designed to format instructions, inputs, and expected outputs in a conversational structure.

### निर्देश:
{instruction}

### इनपुट:
{input}

### उत्तर:
{response}

Fine-Tuning:

The LoRA method is used for parameter-efficient fine-tuning by modifying key transformer layers (e.g., q_proj, k_proj, v_proj).
Training is conducted using SFTTrainer from the trl library, with configurations such as mixed precision (bfloat16), small batch sizes, and linear learning rate schedules.
Inference and Evaluation:

The fine-tuned model is tested on general knowledge and domain-specific questions in Hindi to ensure its understanding and response quality.
The inference process uses preformatted Hindi Alpaca prompts, and the outputs are decoded for review.
Model Deployment:

The final model and tokenizer are saved to Google Drive for future reuse and deployment.

Dataset
The dataset used for fine-tuning is FreedomIntelligence/alpaca-gpt4-hindi, a high-quality Hindi dataset derived from GPT-4 outputs. It contains structured conversations designed for instruction-tuning in the Hindi language.

Structure:
Each data point includes:

Instruction: The task description.
Input: Context or additional information (optional).
Response: The expected output from the model.
Preprocessing:

The dataset is mapped to the custom Hindi Alpaca prompt format.
End-of-sequence tokens (EOS) are appended to ensure proper text generation during training and inference.
This combination of cutting-edge models, efficient fine-tuning techniques, and a well-structured dataset ensures a robust pipeline for high-quality Hindi language generation and understanding.
